# Payment-gateway-spring
This is a payment gateway made in spring with a basic html and css backend simulating an electronic component sales company.

# How to start the proyect
1. Create database in mysql.
2. Put the corresponding credentials.
3. In the line of "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create" put "create" to create the tables and then change it to "update" so as not to override it.

4. To finish inserting the products that you like, I put a test script in case you want to use it.
